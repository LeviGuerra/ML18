If my GitHub represents my portfolio as a programmer, this repository constitutes a compilation of all the machine learning models that I have worked with. Bigger and more ambitious personal projects will be found in other repositories.

Although it does not have didactical purposes, due to how it is organized and how clear the code and the explanations are, it could serve educational purposes.
