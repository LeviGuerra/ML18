# Machine Learning Portfolio

**Author: Levi Guerra**

Compilation of my public Machine Learning (ML) projects. They come in the shape of *Jupyter Notebooks* (Python code with text and images).

This portfolio contains small projects for different types of ML-algorithms (Classical ML algorithms and Deep Learning), and a final section with larger and more ambitious personal ML-projects. Although this repository does not have educational purposes, due to how it is organized and how clear the code and the explanations are, it could have didactical value.
