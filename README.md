# Machine Learning Portfolio

**Author: [Levi Guerra](#About-me)**

Compilation of my public Machine Learning (ML) projects. They come in the shape of *Jupyter Notebooks* (Python code with text and images).

This portfolio contains small projects for different types of ML-algorithms (Classical ML algorithms and Deep Learning), and a final section with larger and more ambitious personal ML-projects. Although this repository does not have educational purposes, due to how it is organized and how clear the code and the explanations are, it could have didactical value.

## Supervised and Unsupervised Learning
  - ### Regression Models
    - [Linear Regression - Boston Housing Dataset](): Having a dataset with information about the housing in Boston, we try to predict the median value of a house. This is done first using a *simple linear regression* and then a *multiple linear regression*.
    - [Polynomial Regression - Insurance Claims Dataset](): Predicting the number of insurance claims in a company by means of the information collected from previous years.
    - [Logistic Regression - Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset](): The Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset contains biophyisical information about different samples of benign and malignant cells. A logistic regression is used to predict whether a cell is from one type or another depending on its characteristic.
    - [Regression Models - MNIST Dataset](): Classifying handwritten numbers (MNIST) by means of different types of regression. 
  - ### K-Nearest Neighbors
    - [KNN Classification - Wine Dataset]()
  - ### K-Means Clustering
    - [K-Means Clustering - Iris Dataset]()
    - [An Unsupervised Approach to MNIST Dataset]() 

## Deep Learning

## Personal Projects
This section is a connection to other larger personal projects. Due to their nature they are present in individual repositories.
