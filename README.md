# Machine Learning Portfolio

**Author: [Levi Guerra](#About-me)**

Compilation of my public Machine Learning (ML) projects. They come in the shape of *Jupyter Notebooks* (Python code with text and images).

This portfolio contains small projects for different types of ML-algorithms (Supervised, Unsupervised and Deep Learning), and a final section with larger and more ambitious personal ML-projects. Although this repository does not have educational purposes, due to how it is organized and how clear the code and the explanations are, it could have didactical value.

## Supervised and Unsupervised Learning
  - ### Regression Models
    - [Linear Regression - Boston Housing Dataset](https://github.com/LeviGuerra/Machine-Learning-Portfolio/blob/master/Codes_and_Datasets/01_Linear-Regression_Boston-Housing-Dataset.ipynb): Prediction of the median value of a house in Boston using a dataset with information about the housing in the city. This is done first using a *simple linear regression* and then a *multiple linear regression*.
    - [Polynomial Regression - Insurance Claims Dataset](https://github.com/LeviGuerra/Machine-Learning-Portfolio/blob/master/Codes_and_Datasets/02_Polynomial-Regression_Insurance-Dataset.ipynb): Predicting the number of insurance claims in a company by means of the information collected from previous years. 
    - [Logistic Regression - Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset](https://github.com/LeviGuerra/Machine-Learning-Portfolio/blob/master/Codes_and_Datasets/03_Logistic-Classification_Breast-Cancer-Wisconsin-Dataset.ipynb): The Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset contains biophyisical information about different samples of benign and malignant cells. A logistic regression is used to predict whether a cell is of one type or another, based on its characteristic.
    - [Regression Models - MNIST Dataset](https://github.com/LeviGuerra/Machine-Learning-Portfolio/blob/master/Codes_and_Datasets/07_Regression-Models_MNIST.ipynb): Classifying handwritten numbers (MNIST) by means of different types of regression. The accuracy between methods can be compared.
  - ### K-Nearest Neighbors
    - [KNN Classification - Wine Dataset](https://github.com/LeviGuerra/Machine-Learning-Portfolio/blob/master/Codes_and_Datasets/04_KNN-Clasification_Wine-Dataset.ipynb): Classifying wines of unknown type based on the similarity in properties (*nearest neighbor*) to other labelled wines.
  - ### K-Means Clustering
    - [K-Means Clustering - Iris Dataset](https://github.com/LeviGuerra/Machine-Learning-Portfolio/blob/master/Codes_and_Datasets/05_K-Means-Clustering_Iris-Dataset.ipynb): Unlabelled flowers of *k* different types are separated into groups/clusters. The optimal number of clusters k is also found.
    - [An Unsupervised Approach to MNIST Dataset](https://github.com/LeviGuerra/Machine-Learning-Portfolio/blob/master/Codes_and_Datasets/06_An-Unsupervised-Approach-to-MNIST.ipynb): Clustering of handwritten digits (MNIST) is performed assuming we don't know how many different types of digits there are.

## Deep Learning
  - ### Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
    - [Multilayer Perceptron - MNIST Dataset](https://github.com/LeviGuerra/Machine-Learning-Portfolio/blob/master/Codes_and_Datasets/08_MLP_MNIST.ipynb): Classifying handwritten digits (MNIST) by means of neural networks. Different multilayer perceptron architechtures and optimizers are used and compared. *Keras* library used.
