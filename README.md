# Machine Learning Portfolio

**Author: [Levi Guerra](#About-me)**

Compilation of my public Machine Learning (ML) projects. They come in the shape of *Jupyter Notebooks* (Python code with text and images).

This portfolio contains small projects for different types of ML-algorithms (Classical ML algorithms and Deep Learning), and a final section with larger and more ambitious personal ML-projects. Although this repository does not have educational purposes, due to how it is organized and how clear the code and the explanations are, it could have didactical value.

A preliminaty analysis of the dataset has been performed everytime a new dataset was introduced.

## Supervised and Unsupervised Learning
  - ### Regression Models
    - [Linear Regression - Boston Housing Dataset](): Having a dataset with information about the housing in Boston, the median value of a house is predicted. This is done first using a *simple linear regression* based on a certain variable, and then a *multiple linear regression* for a subset of them.
    - [Polynomial Regression - Insurance Claims Dataset](): Predicting the number of insurance claims in a company by means of the information collected from previous years.
    - [Logistic Regression - Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset](): The Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset contains biophyisical information about different samples of benign and malignant cells. A logistic regression is used to predict whether a cell is of one type or another depending on its characteristic.
    - [Regression Models - MNIST Dataset](): Classifying handwritten numbers (MNIST) by means of different types of regression. The accuracy between methods can be compared.
  - ### K-Nearest Neighbors
    - [KNN Classification - Wine Dataset](): Classifying wines of unknown type based on the similarity in properties (*nearest neighbor*) to other labelled wines.
  - ### K-Means Clustering
    - [K-Means Clustering - Iris Dataset](): Unlabelled flowers of *k* different types are separated into groups/clusters. The optimal number of clusters k is also found.
    - [An Unsupervised Approach to MNIST Dataset](): Clustering of handwritten digits (MNIST) is performed assuming we don't know how many different types of digits there are.

## Deep Learning
  - ### Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
    - [Multilayer Perceptron - MNIST Dataset](): Classificating handwritten digits (MNIST) by means of neural networks. Different multilayer perceptron architechtures are used and compared. *Keras* library used.

## Personal Projects
This section is a connection to other larger personal projects. Due to their nature they are present in individual repositories.
